// Slash command picker detection.
//
// Reverse-engineered from CC's render pipeline by reading
// claude-code-src/components/PromptInput/PromptInputFooterSuggestions.tsx:
// each picker row is a <Text color={textColor} dimColor={dimColor}> where
// `dimColor = !isSelected` and `textColor = isSelected ? "suggestion" : undefined`.
// That means the SELECTED row gets a bright "suggestion" palette color
// while the non-selected rows get a muted gray color. Both colors show
// up as SGR palette indices in the @xterm/headless buffer — in the dark
// theme we see fg=153 (selected) and fg=246 (dim) on rows that start
// with `/`.
//
// What we do NOT see in the buffer:
//   - `cell.isDim()` is always 0, even though chalk.dim emits SGR 2.
//     Ink or node-pty is collapsing dim-plus-color into a single
//     palette index before the cell gets stored.
//   - `cell.isBold()` / `cell.isItalic()` / `cell.isInverse()` are all 0.
//
// So the signal we rely on is: "row starts with `/`, first cell has a
// non-default fg color." Every picker row matches. The SELECTED row is
// the one whose fg color is DIFFERENT from the others in the picker
// block. We identify the dim color as the most common one and flip
// `selected` on any row whose color doesn't match. Robust to theme
// changes because the rule uses relative distinction rather than
// hardcoded color values.
//
// This parser takes a Terminal instance directly for cell-level
// attribute access — it must run in a Node context where the headless
// xterm Terminal is available. Downstream applications typically call
// it on each screen snapshot and forward the result to their UI layer.

/**
 * Detect CC's slash command picker from the terminal buffer.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 *   1. Walk every row in the active buffer.
 *   2. A row is a candidate picker row if its first non-space cell
 *      contains `/` AND that cell has a non-default fg color
 *      (fgColorMode !== 0).
 *   3. Parse the row text into `{ id, description }` by splitting on
 *      two-or-more spaces — CC left-pads command names to a fixed
 *      column then puts the description after the padding gap.
 *   4. Collect a tuple `{ id, label, description, fgColor }` for each
 *      candidate row. Track the fg color so we can identify the
 *      selected row later.
 *   5. If we found zero rows the picker isn't visible.
 *   6. Otherwise, find the most common fg color (the "dim" color) and
 *      flip `selected: true` on any row whose color differs. In
 *      practice only one row will differ — the one CC has selected.
 *
 * Contiguity is NOT enforced: even if CC ever adds whitespace or a
 * separator between picker rows, we still pick them up as long as
 * each row follows the "slash + non-default fg" rule.
