// Detect CC's "Quick safety check" trust dialog from a screen snapshot.
//
// Why this is its own parser:
//   The trust dialog is a modal interactive screen CC shows when you start
//   a session in a directory it hasn't seen before. Downstream consumers
//   need to handle it in different contexts:
//
//     1. Automated tooling — auto-accept it during scripted recordings
//        so it can capture the main UI without manual intervention.
//     2. GUI applications — recognize it and render a native modal the
//        user can click, instead of leaving it as raw screen text.
//
//   Both use cases share the SAME detection logic. Keeping it in this
//   shared package means every consumer calls into the same pure
//   function and any improvements to the detector benefit all of them.
//
// Why string-match and not regex:
//   The dialog text is stable and English-only in the version of CC we're
//   targeting. A simple substring search is faster, more obvious, and
//   easier to extend than a regex. If CC ships localized versions later
//   we add the new strings to the marker arrays — no rewrite.
//
// Why the parser returns a structured value rather than just a boolean:
//   A GUI consumer will eventually need the option labels to render
//   buttons. Returning `{ visible, options }` future-proofs that.
//   Simpler consumers that only need `visible` can ignore `options`
//   harmlessly.
